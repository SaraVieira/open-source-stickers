# GW Open Source Stickers

Thus far we have two sets of stickers designed by the GW community.  We are excited to debut several stickers created by students in a digital art class in coordination with the GW OSPO.  Please give attribution to these great artists if you use any of their designs.

**We acknowledge that github may be new to many artists.  One of the goals of this project is to encourage artists and people that don't consider themsleves to be technical experts to connect and learn how to collaborate and share.  Do not hesitate to reach out to the [GW OSPO](ospo@gwu.edu) with any questions.**
